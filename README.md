# Learning Node.js & Express

I recently decided to start learning Node.js and fill up gaps I had in my knowledge of the best server-side JavaScript framework ever made.

I utilized the [Node JS Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp) series by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) and I recommend it to anyone wanting to gain a quick overview of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as well as [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

This repository holds all the stuff I created while learning so I can come back to it in the future.

**Note**: Few of the lessons might be missing since those were just introductory lessons and didn't require any coding.
